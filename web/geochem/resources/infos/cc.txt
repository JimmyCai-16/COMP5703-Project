*What Is This Method?
Correlation coefficients take each pair of columns and computes a metric that defines how correlated those two columns are. Here there are three different coefficients computed for each feature pair. This is a very simple method, and is therefore very quick and simple to execute and get some results from, however due to it's lack of sophistication it is vulnerable to even slight issues in datasets and does not have high predictive power in a lot of contexts.
*The Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
The Pearson correlation coefficient measure a linear relationship between two sets of data, by taking the covariance of the two variables and dividing by the product of their standard deviations. The covariance of two random variables is a measure of variability between two variables, where if they are correlated their covariance will be further away from zero in either the positive or negative direction. The standard deviation of a variable is a measure of variability in the data. A lower standard deviation will describe a dataset where measurements are generally closer to the mean, and a higher standard deviation will describe a more 'spread out' variable. Values will always be between -1 and 1, with values closer to -1 indicating a strong negative correlation, and closer to 1 being a strong positive correlation.
*The Kendall Correlation Coefficient.
Similar to the Pearson correlation coefficient, the Kendall correlation coefficient computes a linear correlation between two variables. The difference here is that it uses the notion of concordant pairs to calculate this value. Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are called concordant if both a is greated than c and b is greater than d. This is also the same for less than for both expressions. They are discordant otherwise. Then the difference between concordant and discordant pairs is calulated and divided by the binomial coefficient, the number of ways that two items can be chosen from a number of items uniquely.
*The Spearman Correlation Coefficient.
The Spearman correlation coefficient is almost identical to the Pearson one, except it is only done on the rank variables. The rank variables are instead the ordinal representation of the data set being analysed. For example, the dataset (7.2, 5, 6) would be translated to (3, 1, 2) because that is it's rank order.
