*What Is This Method?
The K-means clustering algorithm aims to partition a number of different observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest centre (or centroid). This is an iterative method, where after the centres are initialised, they are adjusted so that the average distance between every observation to its corresponding centroid is minimised. It is a somewhat inefficient algorithm to compute, and does require the number of clusters to be chosen by the user.
*The Algorithm
The standard K-means algorithm begins by choosing the positions for each of the centroids to begin. This is usually done at random, and done multiple times so as to ensure the initial picks all converge to the same solution. Then, each observation is assigned the centroid that it is closest to. After this has been done, the centroids are recalculated, using the new average for each cluster middle and repeat until the positions of the centroids are stable (or a maximum number of iterations is met).
*How to Interpret a Silhouette Plot.
A silhouette value is a measurement that describes how similar a specific data point is to it's assigned cluster compared to the clusters that it is not assigned to. This value ranges from -1 to 1. Higher values indicate that the entry is well suited to it's own cluster, and not well suited to the other clusters. 'Well suited', in this case, refers to closeness to the average of the cluster (or the centoid), using a distance metric to indicate distance between points in that space.
