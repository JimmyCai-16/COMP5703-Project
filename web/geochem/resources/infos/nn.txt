*What Is This Method?
A dense, artificial neural network is a model used for solving a variety of different artificial intelligence tasks. They somewhat resemble biological neural networks that appear in many animals' brains, hence the name.
A neural network is said to learn about the dataset on which it is trained in a similar way to how a human would learn. When learning something at school, a person will study, try out a variety of problems, check the answers, and then adjust their method by comparing their answer and the correct answer. They adjust their method to have more accurate answers in the future. A neural network does the same thing.
*The Algorithm
A neural network can be thought of as a series of layers, where each layer is given inputs and provides outputs. The input layer in a neural network is some representation of a single observation in the dataset and the output layer in a neural network represents the prediction of some factor (or factors) based on the inputted observation. In a trained neural network, each layer in between the input and output layers can be thought of having learned to identify a different set of patterns in the dataset. Some of these patterns identified by the middle layers in a neural network may be difficult or impossible for humans to notice and interpret. 
Each layer may have multiple nodes (you can think of the nodes as single numbers) where each node’s value is calculated by a weighted sum of all the nodes in the previous layer and then inputted into an activation function (some special function used in neural networks when calculating a node’s value). Each node’s value is initially set to a random value. These values are adjusted during training to improve the accuracy of the network’s predictions of unseen inputs while retaining the power to make accurate predictions based on previously seen inputs.
