*Brief Explanation of Hyperparameters
Linkage method: 'single' will use the minimum distance between each pair of points between two clusters. 'complete' will use the maximum distance instead. 'average' assigns the sum of the distances between each pair of points between two clusters (divided by the products of their cardinalities). 'weighted' will conduct weighted pair group method and arithmetic mean. 'centroid' will assign the difference of the centres of two clusters. 'median' is like the centroid method, but instead of the mean it will use the median. 'ward' uses Ward variance minimisation. This is also known as the incremental algorithm.
Metric: 'euclidean' will use the Euclidean distance between two points as the distance metric, the most common metric. 'seuclidean' uses a standardised Euclidean distance. 'sqeuclidean' will use the squared Euclidean distance. 'cityblock' will use the Manhattan distance. 'cosine' will use the cosine distance. 'correlation' will use the correlation distance. 'hamming' will use the Hamming distance. 'chebyshev' will use the Chebyshev distance. 'canberra' will use the Canberra distance. 'dice' will use the dice distance.
