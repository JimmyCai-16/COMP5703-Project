These come from: https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/public-register/search/ea.php

Specific to QLD. More information about the data seems to be in the `anreturn-register.xlsx` rather than `ea-register.xlsx' which is the primary register.
Only issue with using annual return file over the register is that there are multiple entries per tenement, relative to the renewal year etc.
Need to know how to handle this.
